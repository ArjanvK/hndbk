Documents are pieces of related content in a [Collection](/content/collections/). They're similar to [Pages](/content/pages/), except they belong to a collection rather than the site itself.

### Options

##### Visibility

By default, documents are visible. You can change this by switching it to hidden.

##### Date

The timestamp associated with the document.

##### Permalink

The permalink changes the path the document is accessible at on your site.

##### Layout

Choose which layout you'd like to use. Any layout you have in `_layouts` will be listed here.
